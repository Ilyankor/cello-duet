# cello-duet

This is an experimental piece for two cellos with certain movements based on probability and Markov chains.
Right stochastic matrices are generated by `matrix.py` file.
All of the probabilites used in the piece are outlined in the `master.xls` file.

## Movement II. Pitch

## Movement III. Rhythm

24 rhythms were created (outlined in `rhythms.svg`), with respective probabilities in order given in `master.xls` file, in the sheet titled rhythms.



## Movement VI. Pitch-rhythm

Due to the extra notes created by certain rhythms, a Markov process with transition matrix in master.xls (sheet pr-tr) was used.
This is implemented by pr-tr.py

## Movement VII. Markov

Transposition and inversion, and higher order markov process is used.
