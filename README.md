# cello-duet

This is an experimental piece for two cellos with certain movements based on probability and Markov chains.
* Column stochastic matrices are generated by `matrix.py` file.
* All of the probabilites used in the piece are outlined in the `master.xls` file.
* A `.pdf` file of the piece is here for viewing pleasure.
* Source notation `.mscz` is also here for viewing pleasure.

I intend on creating a Jupyter notebook to consolidate all of the experiments in the future.

## Movement II. Pitch

The B-flat pentatonic pitch collection was chosen (Bb, C, D, F, G). The respective probabilities are given in `master.xls`, worksheet `pitches`. Executing `pitch.py` outputs 75 choices with the given probabilities. Rhythm was determined creatively. The results are displayed in `results.xlsx`. 

## Movement III. Rhythm

Twenty-four (24) different rhythms were created and outlined in `rhythms.svg`. The respective probabilities are given in `master.xls` file, worksheet `rhythms`. Executing `rhythm.py` outputs 75 choices with the given probabilities. Pitch was determined creatively using the A pentatonic collection (A, B, C#, E, F#).  The results are displayed in `results.xlsx`.

## Movement VI. Pitch-rhythm

The D pentatonic pitch collection was chosen (D, E, F#, A, B). The respective probabilities are given in `master.xls`, worksheet `pr-p`.  The twenty-four rhythms are again utilized and the respective probabilites are given in `master.xls`, worksheet `pr-r`. Executing `pr-pr.py` outputs 75 pitch and rhythm choices with the given probabilities. The results are displayed in `results.xlsx`. 

To avoid repitition due to the extra notes created by certain rhythms, a Markov process with transition matrix in `master.xls`, worksheet `pr-tr` was used to generate notes based on the given one. This is implemented in `pr-tr.py`, which asks for the starting note (F = F#) and the total number of pitches in the rhythm (2, 3, or 4) .

## Movement VII. Markov

Transposition and inversion, and higher order markov process is used.
